project_moments_polarized.cpp  code can be used to calculate polarized moments using the fitted amplitudes from AmpTools.

In this code one loops through directories corresponding to different M and t bins, retrieves the complex amplitudes corresponding
to different amplitudes from fit resuls, claculates the moments using the expressions A9 and D8 from Mathiew et. al. paper and writes the 
information in the output file created in the same directory as the code. The name of the output file should be given as an argument with option -o
